// This is a placeholder README for your React + TypeScript project.
// No build tool is currently configured. You must add a bundler (like Webpack) or use a compatible tool to run/build your app.

# How to proceed

- This project is now a plain React + TypeScript codebase.
- To run or build, you must add a build tool (Webpack, Parcel, etc.) or migrate to a compatible framework.
- Example: To use Webpack, add a `webpack.config.js` and the necessary scripts in `package.json`.

## Example scripts for Webpack (not yet configured):

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve --mode development --open",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

---

If you want, I can set up a minimal Webpack config for you. Just ask!
